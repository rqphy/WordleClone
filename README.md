# How does it work ? #1

I'll try to replicate some projects every now and then to understand how they work!

## Wordle 26/02/2022

Today's project was to recreate the Wordle (Motus pour les francais). That game is trending since late 2021 and I kinda like it so I had to try!
The rules are simple : you gotta find a 5 letter word of the day within 6 tries.

Each letter you guess will be highlighted

- Green : the letter is in the right spot
- Yellow : the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot
- Grey : the letter isn't in the word


Have fun !
